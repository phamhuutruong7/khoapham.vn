This project is use to learn about the relation of PHP and MySQL according to a tutorial series on youtube (https://youtu.be/AsyRg_FT_ow).
To deploy this project you will need these things.
1. XAMPP (to create the server side)
2. Database. I attached it above.
To deploy this you need to open XAMPP. (You may need to free the port or fix some bug before you can run. Just run the Apace and MySQL).
Then get to localhost. You will redirect to the localhost/dashboard/
Go to the phpMyAdmin then upload the Database file. You may need to modify another file in MySQL(on XAMPP Board) to make the maximum of the upload file to 800MB.
